.Sh NAME
.Nm rpki-client
.Nd RPKI validation for Route Origin Validation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Bcfjnov
.Op Fl b Ar bind_addr
.Op Fl d Ar cachedir
.Op Fl e Ar rsync_prog
.Op Fl T Ar table
.Op Fl t Ar tal
.Op Ar outputdir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility queries the RPKI repository system with
.Xr @RPKI_RSYNC_COMMAND@ 1
to fetch all X.509 certificates, manifests, and revocation lists under a given
.Em Trust Anchor .
.Nm
subsequently validates each
.Em Route Origin Authorization Pq ROA
by constructing and verifying a certification path for the certificate
associated with the ROA (including checking relevant CRLs).
.Nm
produces lists of the
.Em Validated ROA Payloads Pq VRPs
in various formats.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B
Create output in the file
.Pa bird
in the output directory which is suitable for the BIRD internet routing daemon.
.It Fl b Ar bind_addr
Tell the rsync client to use the specified
.Ar bind_addr
as the source address for connections.
.It Fl c
Create output in the file
.Pa csv
in the output directory as comma-separated values of the prefix in slash notation,
the maximum prefix length, the autonomous system number, and an abbreviation
for the trust anchor the entry is derived from.
.It Fl d Ar cachedir
The directory where
.Nm
will store the cached repository data.
Defaults to
.Pa @RPKI_PATH_OUT_DIR@ .
.It Fl e Ar rsync_prog
Use
.Ar rsync_prog
instead of
.Xr @RSYNC@ 1
to fetch repositories.
It must accept the
.Fl rlt ,
.Fl -address
and
.Fl -delete
flags and connect with rsync-protocol locations.
.It Fl f
Accept out-of-date manifests.
This will still report if a manifest has expired.
.It Fl j
Create output in the file
.Pa json
in the output directory as JSON object.
This format is identical to that
produced by the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator and NLnet Labs routinator.
.It Fl n
Assume that all requested repositories exist: don't update.
.It Fl o
Create output in the file
.Pa openbgpd
in the output directory as
.Xr bgpd 8
compatible input.
If the
.Fl B ,
.Fl c ,
and
.Fl j
options are not specified this is the default.
.It Fl T Ar table
For BIRD output generated with the
.Fl b
option use
.Ar table
as roa table name instead of the default 'roa'.
.It Fl t Ar tal
Specify a
.Em Trust Anchor Location Pq TAL
file to be used.
This option can be used multiple times to load multiple TALs.
By default
.Nm
will load all TAL files in
.Pa @RPKI_TAL_DIR@ .
.It Fl v
Specified once, prints information about status.
Twice, prints each filename as it's processed.
.It Ar outputdir
The directory where
.Nm
will write the output files.
Defaults to
.Pa @RPKI_PATH_OUT_DIR@ .
.El
.Pp
By default
.Nm
produces a list of unique
.Li roa-set
statements in
.Fl o
(OpenBGPD compatible) output.
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "@RPKI_PATH_OUT_DIR@/openbgpd" -compact
.It Pa @RPKI_TAL_DIR@/*.tal
default TAL files used unless
.Fl t Ar tal
is specified.
.It Pa @RPKI_PATH_BASE_DIR@
cached repository data.
.It Pa @RPKI_PATH_OUT_DIR@/openbgpd
default roa-set output file.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.\" For sections 1, 6, and 8 only.
.\" .Sh EXAMPLES
.\" .Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.\" For sections 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 printf/stderr messages only.
